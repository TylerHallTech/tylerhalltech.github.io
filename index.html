<strong>Q: What information does Sideloadly transmit when connecting to the Anisette server?</strong><br>
A: We use our server for Anisette data only. This data is only only transmitted if using the "Remote Anisette" option under Sideloadly's Advanced Options. When using remote anisette, here is the exhaustive list of information our server can see:<br>
- Your IP address<br>
- Your OS (win32, win64 or macOS)<br>
- Sideloadly version.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
That&#39;s all.&nbsp;We don&#39;t share this information with anyone, and it is stored for a limited time for debugging purposes only. Your Apple ID &amp; Password is only sent to Apple servers.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: How do I enable Wi-Fi sideloading via Sideloadly?</strong><br>
A: To enable Wi-Fi sideloading your iDevice, please make sure your computer &amp; iOS device are connected to the same network. Then you will need to initially connect your device via USB and follow these instructions depending on your OS:<br>
<br>
<strong>Windows:</strong> Open iTunes &gt; Connected Device &gt; Summary &gt; Options &gt; Enable &quot;<strong>Sync with this iDevice over Wi-Fi</strong>&quot; option &gt; Sync &amp; Done.<br>
<strong>Latest macOS:</strong>&nbsp;Finder &gt; Select your iDevice under &#39;Locations&#39; &gt; General &gt; Enable &quot;<strong>Show this iDevice when on Wi-Fi</strong>&quot; option &gt; Sync &amp; Done.<br>
<strong>Older macOS:</strong>&nbsp;Open iTunes &gt; Connected Device &gt; Summary &gt; Options &gt; Enable &quot;<strong>Sync with this iDevice over Wi-Fi</strong>&quot; option &gt; Sync &amp; Done.<br>
<br>
In some cases, if Sideloadly is not detecting your device wirelessly, you may need to open iTunes. You also need to have your iDevice screen on for it to be detected.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: How do I enable the Sideloadly Mail Plug-in on macOS?</strong><br>
A: Please open the macOS Mail App and then open Preferences. If you need to login to an email account, you can simply click on the Other option and provide some random information to be able to gain access to Mail&#39;s preferences. Once on the General Preferences window, at the bottom you will see the option to &quot;<strong>Manage Plug-ins</strong>&quot;, click on it and tick/enable the <strong>SideloadlyPlugin.mailbundle</strong>&nbsp;and then click on&nbsp;<strong>Apply and Restart Mail</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: How long will I be able to use the sideloaded app?</strong><br>
A: A normal &amp; free Apple Developer account only allows the app to function for 7 days. After 7 days you can sideload it again using&nbsp; the same Apple ID, just make sure your progress is backed up. Apps signed with a paid Apple Developer Account can last up to 1 year.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: Developer Mode Required. How do I enable developer mode on my iOS device to sideload apps?</strong><br>
A: Since iOS 16+, Apple now requires users to enable &quot;Developer Mode&quot; on their devices in order to allow the sideloading &amp; installation of apps outside of the iOS App Store. To enable Developer Mode go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong> on the iOS device. Scroll down to the Developer Mode list item and navigate into it and enable the developer mode switch.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: How can I save or load my in-game progress?</strong><br>
A: You need to make sure your game progress is being synced over Game Center, Facebook, Twitter or Google+. If the game saves it&#39;s progress locally, you will need to install the IPA overwriting the one you already have installed. In order to overwrite, the modified IPA must have the same bundle ID and you must use the same Apple ID when sideloading. See below for more information.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: Can I overwrite my current app without removing it?</strong><br>
A: Yes,&nbsp;it is possible. In order to accomplish this, you need to sideload the&nbsp;IPA with the same Apple ID that your&nbsp;previously sideloaded app is with.&nbsp;If you previously manually set a custom bundle ID, you need to use the same ID again.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: How many apps can I sideload?</strong><br>
A: iOS 7, 8, 9: You can sideload as many apps as you like on your device. However your free developer account has limitations but you can easily bypass those limitations by creating a new Apple ID. On iOS 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and higher, you can only have 3 sideloaded apps installed on your device at the same time. Apple has limited this and will not allow any more for free Apple Developer accounts. A paid Apple Developer Account does not have such limitations.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: Why can&#39;t I restore my Game Center game progress after sideloading?</strong><br>
A: With the latest iOS versions, Apple has prevented users on free Apple accounts from sideloading apps that have the same bundle ID as an App Store app. In order to sideload on the latest iOS versions, we are forced to set a unique bundle ID and in doing so, Game Center does not recognize the app therefore will not prompt you to restore your save.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: Sideloadly does not show my device?</strong><br>
A: If this happens, try rebooting your PC, open up iTunes while your device is connected &amp;&nbsp;make sure you tap on &#39;<strong>Trust</strong>&#39; from the popup on your iDevice. Then open Sideloadly. If this does not help, connect your device and make sure it is recognized by your PC/iTunes then open Sideloadly. You can also try&nbsp;completely uninstalling then reinstalling iTunes. Also, make sure you are using the web version of iTunes.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: How do I trust the app? How do I fix &quot;Untrusted Developer&quot;?</strong><br>
A: To trust the app after sideloading, you will need to go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>General</strong> -&gt; <strong>Profiles/VPN &amp; Device Management</strong>&nbsp;and once there, tap on the email you used to sideload then trust it.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: Does Sideloadly support iOS 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16?</strong><br>
A: Sideloadly should support iOS 7 up to iOS 16 (and other iOS versions in the future). If you experience any iOS specific issues, do let us know so we can investigate!
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: What kind of .dylibs or .debs can I add to my IPA? App crashes on launch after injecting dylib/deb/framework.</strong><br>
A: All dylib/deb/framework files are supported by Sideloadly, however, some of these files are specifically made for Jailbroken and will causes crashes when sideloaded on non-jailbroken devices. Sideloadly will automatically attempt to update the injected files to support non-jailbroken devices, but it won&#39;t always 100% work due to how they are made.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: Does Sideloadly support Apple Silicon M1/M2 Mac?</strong><br>
A: Yes! Sideloadly has been updated to support Apple Silicon MacBook, Mac Minis and iMacs. When Sideloadly is ran on an Apple Silicon device, it will detect and display the Mac itself on the devices list to install the .IPA to. This has been tested by us on Big Sur, Monterey & Ventura.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: Does Sideloadly work on Apple Silicon M1/M2 Mac with SIP Enabled?</strong><br>
A: Yes! Sideloadly was tested &amp; working with SIP enabled Mac Mini. It is currently uncertain about SIP disabled.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: Why am I receiving no permission error when opening my sideloaded M1/M2 iOS App?</strong><br>
A: This issue happens if the IPA you have sideloaded was encrypted (downloaded through iTunes or straight from your device). In order to fix this, you need to sideload the decrypted version of the IPA.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: How can I use an app-specific Password?</strong><br>
A: App-specific passwords partially works via Sideloadly. App-specific password can only work if you are using a paid Apple Developer ID with anisette option disabled.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Can I make legit In-App Purchases on sideloaded&nbsp;apps?</strong><br>
Unfortunately, no. Apple prevents In-App Purchases from working on sideloaded/enterprise installed apps. If you want to support the developers, install the original App Store version and make In-App Purchases there.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: Which Windows version does Sideloadly support?</strong><br>
A: Sideloadly should work on Windows 7, 8, 10 &amp; 11. For the best results, Windows 10 or higher is recommended.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: Which macOS version does Sideloadly support?</strong><br>
A: Sideloadly should work on macOS 10.12 Sierra and higher. For the best results, macOS Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura &amp; higher&nbsp;is recommended.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<b>Q: "Sideloadly" wants access to control "System Events"?</b><br>
A: This access is requested for Sideloadly to be able to automatically launch and close/minimize the macOS Mail app which is required for it to be open when sideloading. You can disallow access to this request, but in doing so you will have to make sure the Mail app is opened when launching Sideloadly.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<b>Q: The app/IPA was sideloaded successfully, but no app or icon is appearing on my home screen?</b><br>
A: If this happens to you, please reboot your device as that usually helps.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Q: How do I&nbsp;fix &quot;error &lsquo;machineName&rsquo;&quot;?</strong><br>
